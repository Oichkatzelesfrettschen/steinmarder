## Background: How GPUs Execute Code

### CPU vs GPU — The Factory Analogy

A **CPU** is like a factory with 8-16 extremely skilled workers. Each worker can handle any task — complex logic, branching decisions, sequential work — but there are only a few of them.

A **GPU** is like a factory with **thousands** of simple workers. Each one can only do basic math, but there are *so many* of them that they can collectively process massive amounts of data in parallel.

The RTX 4070 Ti Super has **66 SMs** (Streaming Multiprocessors — think of them as departments), each with **128 math units**. That's 8,448 math units running simultaneously.

### Threads, Warps, and Blocks

When you write GPU code (a "kernel"), you launch it with millions of **threads**. Each thread runs the same code but on different data (think: thread 0 processes pixel 0, thread 1 processes pixel 1, etc.).

Threads are grouped:
- **Warp** (32 threads): The hardware *always* executes 32 threads in lockstep. They all run the same instruction at the same time but on different data. This is called **SIMT** (Single Instruction, Multiple Threads).
- **Block** (64-1024 threads): A group of warps that share fast "shared memory" and can synchronize with each other.
- **Grid**: All blocks launched for a kernel.

### The Memory Hierarchy

This is **critical** for understanding our optimizations. GPU memory has multiple levels, each faster but smaller:

```
                Access Time     Size
                ───────────     ────
Registers       ~0 cycles       256 KB per SM (fastest, per-thread)
Shared Memory   ~23 cycles      100 KB per SM (shared within a block)
L1 Cache        ~33 cycles      128 KB per SM (automatic)
L2 Cache        ~200 cycles     48 MB (shared across all SMs)
Global Memory   ~400 cycles     16 GB (VRAM — slowest, largest)
```

The **most common performance bottleneck** is waiting for data from global memory. A single load from L2 takes ~200 cycles — during which the math unit could have done ~200 floating-point operations. Our optimizations focus heavily on hiding this latency.

### What is SASS?

NVIDIA GPUs execute **SASS** (Shader Assembly) instructions. The hierarchy:

```
CUDA C/C++  →  (nvcc compiler)  →  PTX  →  (ptxas assembler)  →  SASS
 (human)                         (virtual)                     (hardware)
```

- **CUDA**: High-level, like regular C++
- **PTX**: An intermediate representation — like a "virtual" assembly language. Each PTX instruction maps to roughly one SASS instruction.
- **SASS**: The actual binary the GPU executes. Instruction opcodes, register numbers, scheduling bits — everything.

We write **inline PTX** inside CUDA code. This gives us control over which instructions are used, while letting the compiler (ptxas) handle register allocation and scheduling.

### Key SASS Instructions We Use

| SASS Instruction | What it does | Latency | Example |
|-----------------|-------------|---------|---------|
| **FFMA** | Fused float multiply-add: `d = a*b + c` | ~4.5 cycles | Dot products, interpolation |
| **LDG.E.64** | Load 64 bits (2 floats) from global memory | ~200 cycles (L2) | Hash table lookups |
| **LDS** | Load from shared memory | ~23 cycles | Weight matrix access |
| **STG** | Store to global memory | ~200 cycles | Writing results |
| **LOP3** | 3-input logic operation (AND, OR, XOR — any combo) | ~4 cycles | Hash function XOR |
| **IMAD** | Integer multiply-add: `d = a*b + c` | ~4 cycles | Address calculation, hashing |
| **MUFU.EX2** | Hardware 2^x approximation (special function unit) | ~6 cycles | Fast exp(), sigmoid |
| **FMNMX** | Float min/max | ~4 cycles | ReLU activation |

## The NeRF Pipeline

NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) turns photographs into 3D scenes. The rendering pipeline has three stages:

```
  3D Point Position (x,y,z)
        │
        ▼
 ┌──────────────────┐
 │ 1. HASH GRID     │  "Encode position into features"
 │    ENCODING       │  Input:  3 floats (x,y,z)
 │                   │  Output: 24 floats (features)
 └────────┬─────────┘
          │
          ▼
 ┌──────────────────┐
 │ 2. MLP FORWARD   │  "Decode features into color"
 │    (Neural Net)   │  Input:  27 floats (24 features + 3 view dir)
 │                   │  Output: 4 floats (R, G, B, density)
 └────────┬─────────┘
          │
          ▼
 ┌──────────────────┐
 │ 3. VOLUME        │  "Composite samples into pixel color"
 │    RENDERING      │  Input:  64 samples × (RGBA, dt) per ray
 │                   │  Output: 1 pixel color (RGBA)
 └──────────────────┘
```

For a 512×512 image, that's **262,144 rays**, each sampling ~64 points along the ray. That's **16.7 million** hash grid + MLP evaluations per frame.

## Kernel 1: Hash Grid Encoding

### What it does

Given a 3D point (x, y, z), encode it into a 24-dimensional feature vector by looking up learned features at multiple resolution levels.

### The Algorithm (step by step)

For each of 12 resolution levels:

```
1. SCALE:  Multiply (x,y,z) by the level's resolution
           Level 0: ×16,  Level 1: ×24,  Level 2: ×36, ... Level 11: ×1388

2. FLOOR:  Find which grid cell the point falls in
           grid_x = floor(scaled_x)
           grid_y = floor(scaled_y)
           grid_z = floor(scaled_z)

3. FRACT:  How far into the cell? (0.0 to 1.0)
           wx = scaled_x - floor(scaled_x)    ← used for interpolation later

4. HASH:   Find the 8 corners of the cube the point is inside
           For each corner (±1 in x,y,z):
             hash = (corner_x × 73856093) XOR (corner_y × 19349663) XOR (corner_z × 83492791)
             index = hash mod 131072          ← index into hash table

5. LOAD:   Read 2 learned features from hash table for each corner
           8 corners × 2 features = 16 values loaded

6. LERP:   Trilinear interpolation (weighted average based on distance)
           4 lerps on X-axis → 2 lerps on Y-axis → 1 lerp on Z-axis
           Result: 2 features for this level
```

After all 12 levels: 12 × 2 = 24 output features.

### Why it's hard to optimize

This kernel is **memory-bound**. Each level does 8 random lookups into a 12MB hash table. "Random" means the addresses are scattered (not sequential), so the GPU cache can't help much. Each lookup takes ~200 cycles to reach L2 cache.

The compute is cheap (a few multiplies, some XORs, interpolation). The bottleneck is waiting for data.

### Our optimizations explained

**1. float2 vectorized loads (16 × LDG.32 → 8 × LDG.64)**

Each hash table entry has 2 floats. Instead of loading them one at a time:
```
load float[0]     ← 1 instruction, 4 bytes
load float[1]     ← 1 instruction, 4 bytes
```
We load them together:
```
load float2       ← 1 instruction, 8 bytes
```
Same data, half the instructions. The GPU's memory bus naturally handles 64-bit loads at the same throughput as 32-bit loads — you get double the data per instruction for free.

**In SASS**: `LDG.E.64.CONSTANT` instead of two `LDG.E.CONSTANT`

**2. Non-volatile asm (the v1 disaster and fix)**

In v1, we used `asm volatile` on every instruction. The `volatile` keyword tells the compiler: "Don't reorder this instruction — execute it exactly here."

Why that's devastating for memory-bound code:
```
// v1 (volatile): compiler MUST keep this order
load A          ← wait 200 cycles for data
load B          ← wait 200 cycles
XOR             ← 4 cycles
multiply        ← 4 cycles
load C          ← wait 200 more cycles
```

What we want the compiler to do (and what v2-v3 allows):
```
// v2+ (non-volatile): compiler CAN reorder
load A          ← start loading (200 cycles)
load B          ← start loading (200 cycles) — overlaps with A!
load C          ← start loading (200 cycles) — overlaps with A and B!
XOR             ← 4 cycles (fills time while waiting for loads)
multiply        ← 4 cycles (fills time while waiting for loads)
use A           ← by now, A has arrived
use B           ← by now, B has arrived
```

This is called **latency hiding** — doing useful work while waiting for slow memory.

**3. Software pipelining across level pairs**

We process two levels at the same time:
```
Phase 1: Hash + issue loads for Level 0 AND Level 1 (16 loads in flight)
Phase 2: Trilinear interpolation for Level 0 AND Level 1
         (by now, loads from Phase 1 have returned)
```

This doubles the number of outstanding memory requests, giving the memory system more chances to serve data while we compute.

**4. LOP3 — 3-input XOR in one instruction**

The hash function does `a XOR b XOR c`. On older GPUs, that requires two instructions:
```
temp = a XOR b
hash = temp XOR c
```

Ada Lovelace (SM 8.9) has **LOP3** — a single instruction that computes ANY 3-input boolean function. We use truth table `0x96` (which encodes XOR-XOR):
```
hash = LOP3(a, b, c, 0x96)    ← 1 instruction!
```

### Results

- **v1**: 0.69x (slower than compiler!) because `volatile` killed load interleaving
- **v2**: 1.03x (fixed the regression, at parity)
- **v3**: 1.11x (float2 loads + SW pipelining beat the compiler)

The SASS: 96 × LDG.E.64.CONSTANT (our kernel) vs ~192 × LDG.E.32 (compiler's kernel)

## Kernel 2: MLP Forward Pass

### What it does

A tiny fully-connected neural network:
```
Input (27 values) → Layer 0 (64 neurons, ReLU) → Layer 1 (64 neurons, ReLU) → Output (4 values, sigmoid)
```

Each layer computes: `output = activation(weight_matrix × input + bias)`

### The math

For one neuron in Layer 0, the computation is a **dot product** of 27 inputs with 27 weights, plus a bias:

```
result = bias + w0*x0 + w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + w26*x26
```

That's 27 multiply-adds for one neuron. Layer 0 has 64 neurons → 64 × 27 = **1,728 multiply-adds**.
Layer 1: 64 × 64 = **4,096 multiply-adds**.
Output: 4 × 64 = **256 multiply-adds**.

Total: ~6,080 multiply-adds per sample. At 262K samples, that's 1.6 billion operations.

### Why this kernel is fast (3.16x speedup)

This kernel is **compute-bound** — the bottleneck is raw math throughput, not memory. That's where manual optimization shines.

**1. 8-wide ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism)**

The GPU's FFMA unit has a 4.5-cycle latency. If you do one multiply-add at a time, you waste 3.5 cycles waiting between each one:

```
// Naive: 1 accumulator (serial dependency chain)
acc += w0 * x0       ← 4.5 cycles (then wait...)
acc += w1 * x1       ← 4.5 cycles (then wait...)
acc += w2 * x2       ← 4.5 cycles (then wait...)
// Throughput: 1 FFMA per 4.5 cycles
```

Instead, we compute 8 neurons simultaneously with 8 independent accumulators:

```
// Our approach: 8 independent accumulators
acc[0] += w0_0 * x0     ← cycle 0
acc[1] += w0_1 * x0     ← cycle 1 (doesn't depend on acc[0]!)
acc[2] += w0_2 * x0     ← cycle 2
acc[3] += w0_3 * x0     ← cycle 3
acc[4] += w0_4 * x0     ← cycle 4
acc[5] += w0_5 * x0     ← cycle 5 (acc[0] result ready by now!)
acc[6] += w0_6 * x0     ← cycle 6
acc[7] += w0_7 * x0     ← cycle 7
acc[0] += w1_0 * x1     ← cycle 8 (no stall! acc[0] was ready at cycle 5)
// Throughput: 1 FFMA per cycle — fully pipelined!
```

The compiler *could* theoretically do this but doesn't — it's conservative about register usage and instruction reordering. We manually force it.

**In SASS**: The kernel generates 6,249 FFMA instructions — nearly everything is fused multiply-add.

**2. Shared memory weight tiling**

The weight matrix (6,212 floats = ~24 KB) is loaded into **shared memory** at the start of each block. Shared memory is ~8.7x faster than global memory (23 vs 200 cycles).

All 128 threads in a block cooperatively load the weights, then everyone reads from shared memory during computation:
```
// Cooperative loading (all threads work together)
for (int i = threadIdx; i < weight_count; i += block_size)
    shared_weights[i] = global_weights[i];
__syncthreads();  // wait for everyone to finish

// Now all 128 threads read from fast shared memory
for (int j = 0; j < 27; j++)
    acc += shared_weights[neuron][j] * input[j];  // LDS.32 (~23 cycles)
```

**In SASS**: 1,553 LDS (shared memory loads) instead of global memory loads.

**3. FMNMX ReLU — one instruction instead of a branch**

ReLU is `max(x, 0)`. A naive if/else:
```
if (x > 0) result = x;
else result = 0;
```
That's a branch, which causes thread divergence on a GPU (some threads in the warp go one way, others go another — both paths execute serially).

Our approach — single instruction, no branch:
```asm
FMNMX result, x, RZ, !PT    // max(x, 0) — RZ is the zero register
```

**In SASS**: 130 FMNMX instructions (64 neurons × 2 layers + 2 extras).

**4. MUFU.EX2 fast sigmoid**

The output layer uses sigmoid: `1 / (1 + exp(-x))`. Standard exp() implementation is ~30 instructions.

We rewrite it using the hardware's fast 2^x unit (MUFU.EX2):
```
sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + 2^(-x × log2(e)))
```

That's: 1 FMUL + 1 MUFU.EX2 + 1 FADD + 1 MUFU.RCP = **4 instructions** total.

**In SASS**: 14 MUFU instructions across the kernel.

### Results

**3.16x speedup** over the reference CUDA kernel, with max error of only 1.19 × 10^-7 (effectively identical results — the tiny error comes from MUFU.EX2 being an approximation).

## Kernel 3: Volume Rendering

### What it does

For each ray (one per pixel), combine all the samples along the ray into one final pixel color. This is **alpha compositing**, the same technique used in video games, Photoshop layers, and movie VFX.

### The algorithm

```python
transmittance = 1.0    # starts fully transparent (light passes through)
color = (0, 0, 0)      # starts black

for each sample along the ray:
    alpha = 1 - exp(-density * step_size)          # how opaque is this sample?
    weight = transmittance * alpha                  # how much does it contribute?
    color += weight * sample_color                  # add weighted color
    transmittance *= (1 - alpha)                    # reduce light passing through
    
    if transmittance < 0.001:                       # already opaque?
        break                                       # stop — nothing behind matters
```

### Our optimizations explained

**1. MUFU.EX2 fast exponential (2 instructions instead of ~20)**

The `exp(-x)` computation is the inner-loop bottleneck. We rewrite it as:
```
exp(-x) = 2^(-x × log2(e))
```
And use the GPU's hardware exponent unit:
```asm
FMUL    neg_xl2e, x, -1.4427    // multiply by -log2(e)
MUFU.EX2 result, neg_xl2e       // hardware 2^x (built-in approximation)
```

Two instructions, ~8 cycles. The standard library `expf()` compiles to ~20+ instructions.

**2. Reusing the exponential result**

Notice: `(1 - alpha) = exp(-sigma * dt)`, which we already computed for alpha!
```
neg_exp = exp(-sigma * dt)
alpha   = 1 - neg_exp
...
transmittance *= neg_exp    // reuse! instead of computing (1 - alpha) again
```

This eliminates a subtraction in the hot loop.

**3. Predicated early exit**

When transmittance drops below 0.001, further samples contribute < 0.1% to the pixel. We stop:
```asm
FSETP.LT  P0, _, transmittance, 0.001  // set predicate if T < threshold
SELP      done, 1, 0, P0               // convert to integer boolean
// then check 'done' and break
```

This is done without divergent branches — the predicate register is set and read without a branch instruction.

**4. Vectorized load/store**

Input RGBA is loaded as `float4` (128-bit, one instruction) and output is stored the same way:
```asm
LDG.E.128  {r, g, b, sigma}, [ptr]    // load 4 floats at once
STG.E.128  [out], {r, g, b, alpha}    // store 4 floats at once
```

### Results

**1.53x speedup**, max error 2.98 × 10^-7 (from MUFU.EX2 approximation error accumulating over 64 steps — still visually identical).
