# Build Decision Matrix

This document narrows the wider `steinmarder` reverse-engineering program to
the evidence that actually changes build choices.

The repo already has plenty of raw captures:

- SASS mnemonic frontiers and timing tables
- CUDA LBM kernel inventory, performance tables, and measured variants
- Apple CPU / Metal / Neural tranche outputs
- Ryzen 5600X3D cache and execution-lane roadmaps
- compiler-flag sweeps, profiler sidecars, and result bundles

What is still missing is a compact, explicit matrix that answers:

- when the compiler already emits the pattern we wanted
- when a manual pattern is still worth keeping
- what the performance, code-size, spill, and complexity tradeoff looks like
- which pattern families should be treated as reusable build templates

## Decision questions

For each probe family, the repo should answer these questions in one place:

1. Does the compiler already produce the desired structure at `-O2`, `-O3`, or
   with the current backend defaults?
2. Does a manual pattern materially improve runtime, spill count, or cache
   behavior?
3. Does the manual version reduce portability, increase compile time, or make
   the code harder to maintain?
4. Is the pattern a one-off research probe, or should it become a reusable
   production helper?

## Evidence dimensions

The missing decision-grade data should be normalized across every lane:

- runtime: wall time, latency, throughput, rows/sec, or counter-derived timing
- code shape: mnemonics, AIR opcodes, disassembly diffs, binary size, spill
  counts, and register pressure
- profiler sidecars: `xctrace`, `perf`, `uProf`, `ncu`, `nsys`, or equivalent
- correctness: sanitizer pass/fail, semantic diffs, and output stability
- maintainability: whether the manual transformation is simple, fragile, or
  compiler-dependent

## Manual patterns worth comparing

These are the manual families that should be compared directly against compiler
output instead of being assumed useful:

- dependent chains for latency characterization
- load/store and stride patterns for cache and memory pressure
- shuffle/broadcast patterns for lane-crossing and vectorization behavior
- atomic and memory-ordering idioms for synchronization cost
- transcendental approximations for special-unit and math-library behavior
- loop unrolling and accumulator splitting for ILP versus register pressure
- threadgroup / shared-memory shaping for Metal occupancy tradeoffs

## What is missing across the repo

### SASS track

- a cross-probe mapping that says which handwritten SASS-like patterns still
  outperform the compiler and which are already compiler-default behavior
- a standardized build-decision ledger that records code size, spills, and
  runtime together instead of treating them as separate notes

### CUDA LBM track

- a decision matrix that says when a CUDA LBM kernel should remain handwritten
  versus when a template or compiler-generated path is sufficient
- a normalized comparison of launch configuration, memory layout, precision,
  and occupancy so kernel variants can be chosen by evidence instead of lore
- a build-decision note that separates “research kernel,” “production kernel,”
  and “compiler-sufficient” cases for the CUDA lane

### Apple track

- a compiler-vs-manual matrix across Apple CPU, Metal, and Neural lanes
- an explicit record of when `clang`, Metal lowering, or Core ML placement
  already produce the desired shape without manual intervention
- a short list of manual transforms that are worth keeping because they change
  the build decision, not just the benchmark score

### Ryzen 5600X3D track

- a cache/stride decision matrix that ties working-set behavior to concrete
  source patterns and compiler outputs
- a clear split between reusable build helpers and one-off tuning experiments
- a normalized counter set that makes cache behavior part of the build choice
  rather than a side quest

## Recommended output files

The repo should eventually produce the following per-tranche artifacts:

- `compiler_vs_manual.csv`
- `manual_pattern_catalog.md`
- `build_decision_notes.md`
- `pattern_recommendations.md`
- `decision_lattice.csv`

Those files should be cross-linked from the Apple and Ryzen roadmaps so the
next person can answer “manual or compiler?” without re-reading every run log.
